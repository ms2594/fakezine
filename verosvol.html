	<div><h3>janice staples</h3></div>

	<div><p>April 2018. I’m walking into Staples to print out some concert tickets in Union Square. I was waiting for my friend to join me, but she’s always running a little late – it’s all good. Staples was mad slow anyway. As I’m printing my shit, a lady of about my height, brown hair, and panicked eyes walks up to me. If you know me, you know I’m a magnet for weird occurrences, and I just roll with it. Why not? Actually, my therapist would probably give me a few reasons as to why not, but that’s for another story.</p></div>

	<div><p>Back to the lady. She was carrying a duffle bag and maybe a suitcase, I can’t remember. She was definitely camping out at the Staples – she said she was waiting for something. Aight, so was I. Let’s talk. She talked about bits of her life that I had absolutely no interest in, yet I pretended to listen. Strangers love telling me about their lives, and quite honestly, I appreciate that. I just might not remember it. That is also why I’m the best secret keeper on Earth.</p></div>

	<div><p>I love secrets.</p></div>

	<div><p>Anyway, she asked me about a phone issue she was having. I don’t know shit about phones, especially iPhones with their shitty user interfaces. She told me there was somebody spying on her through it, and she could prove it. For about 5 minutes, she showed me that every time she tried unlocking her phone, it bugged out a little. Honestly, it looked like her phone just had some water damage, which she probably couldn’t fix. She showed me several videos of ‘evidence’ and even a couple of recordings of weird voicemails she received. I thought, fuck, somebody’s after this woman. At this point, I was invested. I tried figuring it out with her; why was somebody spying on her?</p></div>

	<div><p>Then, it clicked. Nobody’s spying on her. She probably just has schizophrenia or a paranoid personality disorder. This was my first experience with a human experiencing this degree of paranoia. It made sense why she had all her bags on her. She was probably running away. No clue where she was going, but she wanted to make sure I knew she was alright. She gave me her number so she could let me know the next time she got a weird voicemail. As she was typing it into my phone, I finally learned her name – Janice. I still got her contact as ‘Janice Staples.’ The name is very fitting.</p></div>

	<div><p>I never heard from her again, although I did text her once. She didn’t answer – probably got rid of her phone. My therapist said not to do that again though, oops. Janice, I hope you’re alright and flourishing.</p></div>

	<div><p>There’s no moral to this story; I just think about her sometimes.</p></div>

			<div><h3>the ‘how are you feeling’ dilemma</h3></div>
			<div><p>I hate that question, and I know it’s selfish. How dare people ask about my well-being? It’s also hypocritical because I ask it all the time. It’s comforting to ask happy people and hear a relatively normal answer. The thing is, if you’re depressed, that question sets you up for failure no matter how you answer. Here are the options.</p></div>

			<div><p>“Great, thanks for asking.” I know that’s a lie, and I hate lying. I’ve been perpetually sad since I was 5 – I still haven’t gotten the patch update that changes that. Maybe next year when the new iPhone comes out and they start chipping people.</p></div>

			<div><p>“Shitty.” Brutal honesty. Now it’s awkward. You say you’re sorry, and I say it’s okay. One of us changes the subject. I feel responsible for this negative interaction. You might ask why, but I don’t know why. Through a combination of genetics, environmental circumstances, and life decisions, it’s just always been shitty.</p></div>

			<div><p>“Not bad. How are you?” The implication is that I’m not great, but I can quickly change the subject by throwing it back to you. You’ll be busy talking about yourself, so my vague response gets overlooked. Maybe it comes off as inviting, and you can share your struggle too.</p></div>

			<div><p>“Oh, I’ve been super busy.” I hate this response, but it’s the most common and useful. Let’s call it the Ivy League kid response. There’s no time to talk about feelings when you’re busy skipping class and stealing answers from the internet. It’s all due to the fact that we think we need to be busy to be productive, and we get so involved in the concept of busyness we forget about everything else.</p></div>

			<div><p>Lastly, “Wanna hear something crazy?” This is a fun one. It takes the focus away from me, we’re still bonding, and I get to tell one of my many stories. This is usually the route I take – it’s entertaining for both of us. The downside is we completely ignored the question, and neither of us knows how the other’s doing.</p></div>

			<div><p>At this point, you’re probably asking, “What can I ask you?” Anything else. I’m not that picky. Controversial, but I quite like, “Are you okay?” A quick yes will settle it. A no is welcome, but not necessary. Simple.</p></div>

			<div><p>Does it matter that much? No, it really doesn’t.</p></div>

			<div><h3>frank’s inferno</h3></div>
			<div><p>After graduating high school, I flew directly to NYC. I didn’t know a single soul, so I spent most of my days commuting to Union Square and walking around. This was back in the day when I frequently read for pleasure, or as many would call it, the “pre-college era.” College really takes the life out of you like that – or maybe it was just the Ivy experience.</p></div>

			<div><p>Anyway, I bought a couple of books from some man’s stand, one of the books being Dante’s Inferno. This particular copy was raggedy and foxed. Honestly, it looked quite golden. It was beautiful.</p></div>

			<div><p>I was walking down St. Mark’s Place when an old man stopped me. He looked at the books in my hand, then started reciting the first page of Dante’s Inferno in English, then in Italian. I wish I could give you a vivid description of what he looked like, but I don’t remember. Just picture him as an average white, old man. He introduced himself as Frank, a former professor of I don’t remember where. After some small talk that I also do not remember, he offered to sell me a book for one dollar. He boasted about the library in his apartment, housing over one thousand books. Of course, I said yes. Frank starts climbing up his stoop and motions me to follow him. Stranger danger? Never heard of it. I followed him inside.</p></div>

			<div><p>This apartment building was crummy. Shit looked ancient, just like Frank. As I reached the bottom of his staircase, I realized I probably shouldn’t follow this elderly stranger into his home. I weighed the pros and cons in my mind. Pros – I could get to see the thousands of books he mentioned. Cons – possibly getting murdered. I decided I would just visit the New York Public Library if I really wanted to see multitudes of books on shelves.</p></div>

			<div><p>I was ready to sacrifice my life for this one-dollar novel, even though I knew I’d probably never read it. I remember thinking, “Damn, this is where I die. Fine.” Evidently, I did not, but that is a sentence I’ve said to myself quite a few times.</p></div>

			<div><p>After a few minutes, Frank came back downstairs, and we concluded our business transaction. I don’t remember the title of the book, nor did I ever read it. I do, however, think of Frank every time I’m in a near-death situation. Maybe he’s my Virgil.</p></div>
