<p class="center"> I'm not sure what fake zine is. I've been attempting to write a short blurb for years. Plainly, it's a website where we post our art and writing. Sometimes we collaborate on a project as a team, and sometimes we post our own, individual work. We also accept submissions (completed or uncompleted work) and put them together to build a zine. It's a home, a community, a hub for artists. </p>
